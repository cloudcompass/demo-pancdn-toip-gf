# Risk Assessment

The following are a list of risks identified about the ecosystem and the
governance of the ecosystem that have been evaluated. To add to this list we
recommend adding an issue to the repository with the risk and the community will
determined if and how the risk and mitigation should be added to this assessment
via a pull request.

## Spam issues and pull requests

Those that have concerns with this work may decide to protest by raising issues
and pull requests intended to disrupt the work and the ecosystem.

**Mitigation:** As we begin building this ecosystem, we welcome participation and
encourage valuable discussion. As such we don't want to do anything to
proactively address this concern that might have the side-effect of reducing
contributions. If spam becomes a problem, we'll investigate various GitHub tools
that can be used help to mitigate the attack.

## Inappropriate Requests from Contributing Organizations

Inappropriate requests may come from organizations that some might deem should
not be part of the community. Since governments are members in this ecosystems
there may be freedom of speech questions around such contributions.

**Mitigation:** Such issues will be passed to the member organizations to decide
on the merits of the submission.

## Scale of the Schema, Issuer and Verifier Sections

As the ecosystem grows, the presentation of the Schema, Issuer and Verifier
sections may become unusable because of the shear number of documents make it
impossible to find information of interest.

**Mitigation:** The website publishing pipeline can be adjusted to make search and
discovery easier. For example, tags can be used to categorize the documents in
those sections of the site.
