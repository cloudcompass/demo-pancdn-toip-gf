# Governance Policy

This document provides the governance policy for this Ecosystem
Governance Framework and the documents developed by the ecosystem
participants using the [contribution process](CONTRIBUTING.md).  All
participants and must adhere to the requirements in this document.

## Organizational Roles

### Members Organizations

Members are organizations that have voting privileges in the ecosystem
[decision-making](#decision-making) process. The members operate the ecosystem
via authorizations they delegate to individuals within their organizations. An initial
list of members was established when the ecosystem was created and is
periodically updated by current the members via the decision making process.

Member organizations are identified by their GitHub Organization account.

#### Current Members

* Government of British Columbia
* Government of PROVINCE2
* Gouvernement du Québec
* Institute for Citizen-Centred Service - Institut des services axés sur les citoyens (ISSC / ISAC)

### Contributing Organizations

Contributing organizations are entities that submit issues and pull request to
the GitHub repository that generates this site and participate in discussions
around issues and pull requests, but that lack voting participation in the
ecosystems [decision-making](#decision-making) process.

Contributor organizations are identified by their GitHub Organization account.

#### Current Contributors

This is a list of contributing organizations that have requested their names
are included here:

* Law Society of BC
* Canadian Association of Banks and Financial Institutions
* Canadian Association of Real Estate Professionals

### Reader Organizations

Reader organizations are entities that use this site as a resource for
developing their own verifiable credential capabilities. For example, such
organizations use the information to find useful issuers of verifiable
credentials to be verified, and the ToIP Layer 1 and Layer 2 information to
create a verifier that can be integrated into their applications.

Since the ecosystem governance framework is public, reader organizations need
not be identified.

## Individual Roles

The ecosystem defines the following roles for individual participants.
Additional roles may be adopted and documented by the
[members](#ecosystem-members).

### Maintainers

“Maintainers” are responsible for administering access to the GitHub repository
that holds the ecosystem governance framework in accordance with the decisions
made by the member organizations. Maintainers may also perform the role of
Editor.

Maintainers are identified by their GitHub account and their membership
in a member GitHub Organization account.

#### Current Maintainers

* Stephen Curran - Government of British Columbia

### Editors

“Editors” are responsible for managing the GitHub issues and pull requests
around developing, maintaining, and updating the ecosystem governance framework
through contributions. In practical terms, the Editors are given permissions in
the GitHub repository to close issues and to approve and merge or close pull
requests. In carrying out their practical tasks, Editors are also responsible
for determining consensus and coordinating appeals, and ensuring that the rules
for the content and format of the documents that make up the ecosystem
governance framework are followed. The members of the ecosystem governance
framework will designate one or more Editors. The Editors are themselves
[contributors](#contributors), and may or may not be [voters](#voters).

Editors are also responsible for enforcing the ecosystem code of conduct as
outlined in the [Code of Conduct](Code_of_Conduct.md) document.

Editors are identified by their GitHub account and their membership
in a member GitHub Organization account.

#### Current Editors

* Stephen Curran

### Voters

Voters are individuals that have delegated authority from their [member
organization](#member-organizations) to participate as voting members in the
ecosystem [decision-making](#decision-making) process.  Voters carry out their
role by contributing to the GitHub repository through issues and pull requests,
and by participating in any necessary decision-making processes/meetings about the ecosystems.

Voters are identified by their nomination to the role by their member
organization. It is assumed that all voters are known by the set of voters.
Voters GitHub actions are identified by their GitHub account and their
membership in a member GitHub Organization account.

#### Current Voters

* Stephen Curran

### Contributors

"Contributors" are individuals that are members of [Contributing
Organizations](#contributing-organizations) that participate in the ecosystem,
but do not have a vote in the ecosystem [decision-making](#decision-making)
process. Contributors contribute to the ecosystem via GitHub issues and pull
requests and in discussions.

Contributors are identified by their GitHub account and their membership
in a contributor GitHub Organization account.

## Ecosystem Content Ownership

The ecosystem governance framework, as represented by the contents of the source
GitHub repository, and the website published from the repository is managed by
the member organizations via delegations to the Maintainers and Editors.

Each piece document on the website is owned by a given organization or group of
organizations. The owner controls the content of the document, with some
limitations. Specifically:

* All of the documents except the Schema, Issuer and Verifier documents
are owned by the Member Organizations.
    * While contributors are welcome to propose changes (via pull requests) to those documents, the member organizations approve and merge those changes.
* The Schema, Issuer and Verifier documents are owned by the Schema Publisher, Issuer and Verifier organizations, respectively.
    * The content in those documents are written and revised by the owner.
    * The owner must follow the editing guidelines of the ecosystem, such as using the [templates](Document%20Templates/README.md) required to be used.
    * The role of the Editors in merging documents owned by Schema Publishers, Issuers and Verifiers is to ensure that submitter or approver of the pull request represents the owner organization, and that the document follows the content guidelines as expressed by the [templates](Document%20Templates/README.md).

## Decision Making

This section outlines the current decision making process in this ecosystem governance framework.
This process may be changed by pull requests to the ecosystem governance framework repository
that are approved by the members and merged.

### Consensus-Based Decision Making

The ecosystem participants (members and contributors) make decisions through a
consensus process (“Approval” or “Approved”).  While the agreement of all
participants is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Editors
will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of
factors, including the dominant view of the Voters and nature of support and
objections.  The Editors will document evidence of consensus in accordance with
these requirements.

### Appeal Process

Decisions may be appealed via a pull request or an issue, and that appeal will
be considered by the Editors in good faith, who will respond in writing within a
reasonable time. As necessary, in extreme circumstances the Editors may go to
the Voters and the Member Organizations to resolve an appeal.
