# Governance Policy

This document provides the governance policy for the Pan-Canadian Ecosystem
Governance Framework (PCEGF) and the documents developed by the PCEGF
participants using the [contribution process](CONTRIBUTING.md).  All
participants and must adhere to the requirements in this document.

## Organizational Roles

### Ecosystem Authorities

Authorities are organizations that have voting privileges in the ecosystem
[decision-making](#decision-making) process. The authorities operate ecosystem
via authority they delegate to individuals within their organization. An initial
list of Authorities was established when the ecosystem was created and is
periodically updated by current the Authorities via the decision making process.

#### Current Authorities

* Cloud Compass Computing Inc.

### Contributing Organizations

Contributing organizations are organizations that submit issues and
pull request to the GitHub repository that generates this site, but that lack
any voting participation in the ecosystems [decision-making](#decision-making)
process.

## Individual Roles

The ecosystem defines the following roles for individual participants. Additional roles may be
adopted and documented by the [Authorities](#ecosystem-authorities).

### Maintainers

“Maintainers” are responsible for administering access to the GitHub PCEGF
repository in accordance with the decisions made by the PCEGF Authority
Organizations. Maintainers may also perform the role of Editor.

#### Current Maintainers

* Stephen Curran

### Editors

“Editors” are responsible for managing the GitHub issues and pull requests
around developing, maintaining, and updating the PCEGF through contributions. In
practical terms, the Editors are given the ability in the GitHub repository to
close issues and to approve, merge and close pull requests. In carrying out
their practical tasks, Editors are also responsible for determining consensus
and coordinating appeals, and ensuring that the rules for the content and format
of the documents that make up the PCEGF are followed. The participants of the
PCEGF will designate one or more Editors. The Editors are themselves
Participants. Editors are also responsible for enforcing the ecosystem code of
conduct as outlined in the [Code of Conduct](Code_of_Conduct.md) document.

#### Current Editors

* Stephen Curran

### Voters

Voters are individuals that have delegated authority from their [Authority
Organization](#authority-organizations) to participate as voting members in the
ecosystem [decision-making](#decision-making) process.  Voters carry out
their role by contributing to the GitHub repository through issues and pull
requests and by participating in decision-making meetings about the ecosystems.

#### Current Voters

* Stephen Curran

### Contributors

"Contributors" are individuals that are members of [Contributing
Organizations](#contributing-organizations) that participate in the ecosystem,
but do not have a vote in the ecosystem [decision-making](#decision-making)
process. Contributors contribute to the ecosystem via GitHub issues and pull
requests and in discussions.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Decision Making

The ecosystem participants make decisions through a consensus process (“Approval” or
“Approved”).  While the agreement of all Participants is preferred, it is not
required for consensus. Rather, the Editors will determine consensus based on
their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant
view of the Participants and nature of support and objections.  The Editors will
document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.

### Appeal Process

Decisions may be appealed be via a pull request or an issue, and that appeal
will be considered by the Editors in good faith, who will respond in writing
within a reasonable time. As necessary, in extreme circumstances the Editors may
go to the Participant Organizations to resolve an appeal.

## Note

> The remainder of this document is taken verbatim from the Linux Foundation's
    Community Specification document. It needs to be updated for the PCEGF.

## Ways of Working

Inspired by [ANSI’s Essential Requirements for Due
Process](https://share.ansi.org/Shared%20Documents/Standards%20Activities/American%20National%20Standards/Procedures,%20Guides,%20and%20Forms/2020_ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf),
Community Specification Working Groups must adhere to consensus-based due
process requirements.  These requirements apply to activities related to the
development of consensus for approval, revision, reaffirmation, and withdrawal
of Community Specifications.  Due process means that any person (organization,
company, government agency, individual, etc.) with a direct and material
interest has a right to participate by: a) expressing a position and its basis,
b) having that position considered, and c) having the right to appeal. Due
process allows for equity and fair play. The following constitute the minimum
acceptable due process requirements for the development of consensus.

### Openness

Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly
and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue
financial barriers to participation. Voting membership on the consensus body
shall not be conditional upon membership in any organization, nor unreasonably
restricted on the basis of technical qualifications or other such requirements.
Membership in a Working Group’s parent organization, if any, may be required.

###  Lack of Dominance

The development process shall not be dominated by
any single interest category, individual or organization. Dominance means a
position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason
of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and
equitable consideration of other viewpoints.

### Balance

The development process should have a balance of interests.
Participants from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective
of achieving balance.

### Coordination and Harmonization

Good faith efforts shall be made to
resolve potential conflicts between and among deliverables developed under this
Working Group and existing industry standards.

### Consideration of Views and Objections

Prompt consideration shall be
given to the written views and objections of all Participants.

### Written procedures

This governance document and other materials
documenting the Community Specification development process shall be available
to any interested person.

## Specification Development Process.  

### Pre-Draft

Any Participant may submit a proposed initial draft
document as a candidate Draft Specification of that Working Group.  The
Maintainer will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.

### Draft

Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be
Approved to become a” Draft Specification”.  Once the Working Group approves a
document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for
all going forward work on that specification.

### Working Group Approval

Once a Working Group believes it has achieved
the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve
that Draft Specification and progress it to “Approved Specification” status. 

### Publication and Submission

Upon the designation of a Draft
Specification as an Approved Specification, the Maintainer will publish the
Approved Specification in a manner agreed upon by the Working Group Participants
(i.e., Working Group Participant only location, publicly available location,
Working Group maintained website, Working Group member website, etc.).  The
publication of an Approved Specification in a publicly accessible manner must
include the terms under which the Approved Specification is being made available
under.

### Submissions to Standards Bodies

No Draft Specification or Approved
Specification may be submitted to another standards development organization
without Working group Approval. Upon reaching Approval, the Maintainer will
coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Specification or Approved
Specification to another standards development organization. Working Group
Participants that developed that Draft Specification or Approved Specification
agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions.

## Non-Confidential, Restricted Disclosure

Information disclosed in connection with any Working Group activity, including
but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not
confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Working Group is collaborating via a
private repository, the Participants will not make any public disclosures of
that information contained in that private repository without the Approval of
the Working Group.
